## Summary
Recovering obfuscated Android application are big challenging issues among the research of Digital Forensic areas. 
Because most Android application developers generate their applications by implementing obfuscation techniques in order to avoid hackers or malicious users.  

In this project, I have tested with obfuscated android applications using recent tools FlowDroid, a static taint analysis tool for Android applications, and MiniDroid, a light version of FlowDroid that has time-efficient to generated call graph.
MiniDroid achieves approximately 20% of time reductions compared with FlowDroid and generates the exact same output even Android applications are obfuscated with four different methods of obfuscation.
